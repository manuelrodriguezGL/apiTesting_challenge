Can be improved?

- I think that you are using testng listeners but I think you are not using them, I did not see it in the testNG.xml file.
// I'm using @Listeners(TestExecutionListener.class) annotation in TestBase

- A lot of statics variables, for example:
	private static CustomerEndpoint customerEndpoint;

- In this case you can just return without defining a variable since it will be returned in the next line DONE
        Response response = requestSpecification.given()
            .contentType(ContentType.JSON)
            .when()
            .put(endpointPath);
        return response;

- postCustomer and other tests is just checking status code, try to see if there are more criteria to validate.
- product tests are checking just status code as well
